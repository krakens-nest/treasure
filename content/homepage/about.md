A LARP, or Live-Action Role-Play, is an immersive experience where participants portray characters and enact scenes within a shared narrative. It allows us to leave our normal everyday life behind and together we step into another world. This only works if everyone is on board, fully committing to their roles and the story.

Our LARP is set in the Golden Age of Pirates, so please avoid talking about modern inventions, such as phones or TVs, to maintain the authenticity and magic of the era. The event will be held in English and beginners are welcome. We'll guide you through this adventure where you can be a pirate, uncovering treasures and navigating curses!
