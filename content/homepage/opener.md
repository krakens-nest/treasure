Step into the Golden Age of Piracy in our LARP, "Kraken's Treasure."

Join Captain Blackbeard's crew on the ship the _Unicorn's Sting_ as they celebrate their triumphant acquisition of the mythical Kraken's Treasure. But beware, for unrest brews in the crew with tales of a sinister curse that haunts the gleaming coins.

Will you seize your fortune or fall victim to the Kraken's curse? Embark on a fantastical journey of pirates, treasure, and supernatural perils. Are you ready to sail into legend?
