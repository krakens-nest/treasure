Save the date! 

This month, the 31st of May, DSU Game Writing 23 will host a LARP at Kulturlabbet! The theme is: Pirates! The LARP will be held in English.

What is a LARP, you may ask? LARP is an acronym for Live Action Role-Playing game. You as a player will be invited into a fictional world existing within a real-world space (Kulturlabbet).  You will physically portray a character through acting and costumes!

More information about the event will be delivered within next week, keep yer eye out for it! We hope that you join us, the more sailors the merrier!
