Our rules exist to create a safe and comfortable atmosphere.

##### Opting Out
If you need to withdraw from any activity during the LARP, you can do so by placing your hand over your heart, signaling your choice to the other participants. Additionally, an opt-out room will be available on-site, offering a space for you to decompress, take a break, and stay hydrated.

##### Clothing Guidelines
We request that all participants attend dressed as pirates. Your outfits can be simple, including items such as a white or striped shirt, a vest or jacket, and a pair of trousers. Enhance your look with accessories like bandannas and scarves to fully embrace the pirate theme. Feel free to go all out if you have the perfect pirate outfit. Please note that no weapons (fake or otherwise) or sharp objects are allowed.

##### Alcohol Restriction
While alcohol and intoxication will be portrayed during the LARP, no real alcohol or intoxicated people will be allowed. If you bring alcohol or try to enter intoxicated, you will be removed from the premises.
